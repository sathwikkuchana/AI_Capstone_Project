While government organizations must provide the best scientific climate predictions in a way that can be understood by farmers, there should be greater efforts to promote more accurate information, sounder advice, and financial support through loans and credit in case of severe problems. This will make farmers feel adequately protected. In other words, the focus should be to build trust by promoting safety. Risk salience was the greatest predictor of beliefs and adaptation behavior. Public perceptions of local risks from global warming are increasingly important as communities face decisions about how best to adapt to coming changes (Akerlof et al., 2013). Moreover, our findings indicate a need to increase knowledge regarding CC (cause, impact, and adaptation) to encourage farmers to mitigate and respond to CC. This is in line with the findings of O\\'Connor et al. (1999) that knowledge about the causes of global CC will foster behavioral intentions to take action. Improving farmers\\' knowledge with respect to CC could be considered a long-term, structural response to CC. Our findings suggest that effective responses by farmers will be achieved through farmers\\' self-efficacy. Tackling CC requires the fostering of farmers\\' abilities, skills, and resources. Thus, climate policymakers should seek to gain widespread support from the farming community to encourage the adoption of mitigation and adaptation behaviors; and strategies should ensure that --- # Y.

Increasing empirical evidence has confirmed that adaptation strategies to CC at the farm level can significantly reduce the negative impacts of CC and minimize vulnerability. Consequently, understanding adaptation to CC has become a major concern for farmers to facilitate adaptation actions and assist them in improving their adaptive capacity. In this context, this study investigated the most prominent psychological drivers of, and impediments to, adaptation responses. To this end, 350 farmers from Kermanshah district in western of Iran were selected as our sample through a multi-stage, stratified, random sampling method. Structural equation modeling found a complex relationship between overall CC belief, risk perception, psychological distance, trust and risk salience, and farmers\\' adaptation behaviors. Climate risk perception, trust, and psychological distance were much more effective in driving farmers‚Äô adaptation behaviors. The findings yield recommendations for public policy and risk communication that could encourage adaptation behaviors among Iranian farmers. # 1. Introduction Climate change (CC) is a certain, irrefutable, undisputed, clear, unequivocal, and imminent reality, and potentially a serious threats and challenges to the agricultural sector. This could lead to increased vulnerability and the spread of poverty (Ado et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2016; Wood et\\\\n5) al., 2014). Farmers (mostly smallholders) in developing countries are likely to suffer more under the negative effects of CC than those in developed countries because of their heavy reliance on agriculture and natural resources. Thus, adaptation measures to this pressure are urgently needed (Feola et al., 2015; Azadi et al., 2019). Mounting empirical evidence has confirmed that informed, robust implemented adaptation approaches to CC at the farm level are effective coping strategies that can maintain yields, significantly reduce the negative impacts of CC, and minimize vulnerability (Wood et al., 2014). Thus, adaptation has been a worldwide concern to the degree that it has become equated with development policy: ‚Äúgood development policy is good adaptation policy‚Äù (De la Torre et al., 2009). Consequently, understanding adaptation to CC has become a major concern to various stakeholders and policymakers. Consequently, considerable efforts have been made by climate modelers, geographers, and economists to study farm adaptation to CC (Mitter et al., 2018; Rogers et al., 2012). While the general concept of adaptation is a rather well-established part of the CC literature, there is a general dearth of study on the psychological aspects (Le Dang et al., 2014). Without considering socio-psychological variables, studies have been unable to determine the public\\'s perception and thoughts on CC. Furthermore, Grothmann and Patt (2005) concluded that psychological variables are able to predict self-protective action with more accuracy than socioeconomic variables. Moreover, Clayton et al. (2015) argued that psychology as a ‚Äòhub‚Äô discipline has provided unique contribution to understanding and addressing CC through gathering important information concerning individual- and household-level factors in socio-ecological systems. Therefore, the theory of adaptation needs to be expanded to include socio-psychological factors. Furthermore, Swim et al. (2011) have argued that psychology can help to understand the process of responses to CC. Deressa et al. (2011),\\\\n\\\\nUser question:\\\\n1.

While government organizations must provide the best scientific climate predictions in a way that can be understood by farmers, there should be greater efforts to promote more accurate information, sounder advice, and financial support through loans and credit in case of severe problems. This will make farmers feel adequately protected. In other words, the focus should be to build trust by promoting safety. Risk salience was the greatest predictor of beliefs and adaptation behavior. Public perceptions of local risks from global warming are increasingly important as communities face decisions about how best to adapt to coming changes (Akerlof et al., 2013). Moreover, our findings indicate a need to increase knowledge regarding CC (cause, impact, and adaptation) to encourage farmers to mitigate and respond to CC. This is in line with the findings of O'Connor et al. (1999) that knowledge about the causes of global CC will foster behavioral intentions to take action. Improving farmers' knowledge with respect to CC could be considered a long-term, structural response to CC. Our findings suggest that effective responses by farmers will be achieved through farmers' self-efficacy. Tackling CC requires the fostering of farmers' abilities, skills, and resources. Thus, climate policymakers should seek to gain widespread support from the farming community to encourage the adoption of mitigation and adaptation behaviors; and strategies should ensure that --- # Y.

Increasing empirical evidence has confirmed that adaptation strategies to CC at the farm level can significantly reduce the negative impacts of CC and minimize vulnerability. Consequently, understanding adaptation to CC has become a major concern for farmers to facilitate adaptation actions and assist them in improving their adaptive capacity. In this context, this study investigated the most prominent psychological drivers of, and impediments to, adaptation responses. To this end, 350 farmers from Kermanshah district in western of Iran were selected as our sample through a multi-stage, stratified, random sampling method. Structural equation modeling found a complex relationship between overall CC belief, risk perception, psychological distance, trust and risk salience, and farmers' adaptation behaviors. Climate risk perception, trust, and psychological distance were much more effective in driving farmers‚Äô adaptation behaviors. The findings yield recommendations for public policy and risk communication that could encourage adaptation behaviors among Iranian farmers. # 1. Introduction Climate change (CC) is a certain, irrefutable, undisputed, clear, unequivocal, and imminent reality, and potentially a serious threats and challenges to the agricultural sector. This could lead to increased vulnerability and the spread of poverty (Ado et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2016; Wood et\\n5) al., 2014). Farmers (mostly smallholders) in developing countries are likely to suffer more under the negative effects of CC than those in developed countries because of their heavy reliance on agriculture and natural resources. Thus, adaptation measures to this pressure are urgently needed (Feola et al., 2015; Azadi et al., 2019). Mounting empirical evidence has confirmed that informed, robust implemented adaptation approaches to CC at the farm level are effective coping strategies that can maintain yields, significantly reduce the negative impacts of CC, and minimize vulnerability (Wood et al., 2014). Thus, adaptation has been a worldwide concern to the degree that it has become equated with development policy: ‚Äúgood development policy is good adaptation policy‚Äù (De la Torre et al., 2009). Consequently, understanding adaptation to CC has become a major concern to various stakeholders and policymakers. Consequently, considerable efforts have been made by climate modelers, geographers, and economists to study farm adaptation to CC (Mitter et al., 2018; Rogers et al., 2012). While the general concept of adaptation is a rather well-established part of the CC literature, there is a general dearth of study on the psychological aspects (Le Dang et al., 2014). Without considering socio-psychological variables, studies have been unable to determine the public's perception and thoughts on CC. Furthermore, Grothmann and Patt (2005) concluded that psychological variables are able to predict self-protective action with more accuracy than socioeconomic variables. Moreover, Clayton et al. (2015) argued that psychology as a ‚Äòhub‚Äô discipline has provided unique contribution to understanding and addressing CC through gathering important information concerning individual- and household-level factors in socio-ecological systems. Therefore, the theory of adaptation needs to be expanded to include socio-psychological factors. Furthermore, Swim et al. (2011) have argued that psychology can help to understand the process of responses to CC. Deressa et al. (2011),\\n\\nUser question:\\n1.

Interviewees were asked about their knowledge related to climate change (Table 1, Questions (1) and (2)). Table 3 reports the percentage distributions of responses to these questions. Over half of the farmers (52.9%) indicated that they knew the concept of global climate change (Question (1)). There is not obvious knowledge difference among regions. For example, about 47.5%, 57.2%, and 55.5% answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù in Guangdong, Shanxi, and Qinghai respectively. The second question (Question (2)) was a follow-up conditional on having answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù in Question (1). As shown in Table 3, conditional on knowing the concept of climate change, a vast majority (91.2%) of the respondents answered that the temperature is reported to be rising. As such, in all the three provinces the percentage reached at least 85%. Household interviewees were also asked about their knowledge related to the concept of GHG emission (Table 1, Questions (3) and (4)), which is another important concept associated with climate change. Their answers are shown in Table 4. The percentage of farmers who have heard about the\\n2) of priority for policy interventions. Finally, a great deal of interest also exists in analyzing the direct impact of perceptions on adaptation. To have more policy implications on adaptive risk management, more research efforts should be made in collecting data on dynamic perceptions on both climate change and extreme events.

In addition, some crop production information of the household, and some demographic information of the respondents (gender, education level, age, residence location) and household characteristics (household size, acreage of land owned, and wealth) were also collected. The latter information would probe deeper into the insights and perspectives of farmers. In this research the authors mainly dealt with four major issues. The first concerned farmers‚Äô knowledge about climate change. More specifically, the authors asked them if they heard about ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù and if so, what they had heard about the temperatures becoming higher or lower? By use of an open question, the authors additionally asked farmers to identify the main channels of receiving knowledge about climate change. The second issue concerned farmers‚Äô perceptions of climate change; the authors asked the following two sets of questions about farmers‚Äô perceptions on long-term changes in mean temperature, mean precipitation and the frequency of extreme weather events (such as drought, flood, and frost) in the past ten years. The third issue concerned farmers‚Äô knowledge towards the relationship between GHG emission and climate change. The authors want to specify whether a relationship exists between farmers‚Äô perceptions of climate change and chemical fertilizer application. The last issue concerned farmers‚Äô reactions to three possible extreme weather events; whether they would adjust cropping structure (changing to different crops) when the weather becomes hotter and rainfall decreases. # Analysis Survey results were entered into STATA version 11.2 for analysis. Basic descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample population and responses to each question. # Farmers‚Äô Perceptions on Climate Change # Individual and household socio-economic characteristics In the household survey, the authors also collected detailed information on their basic socio-economic characteristics. Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for\\n4) \"unchanged\" 16.5% precipitation were almost the same. # Perceptions of farmers towards climate change and variability # Perceptions of farmers towards long term climate change In a household survey, the authors asked the following two sets of questions, farmers\\' perception on air temperature, precipitation and the frequency of extreme weather events in the past ten years (Table 1, Questions (6)¬±(10)). While these questions were difficult for many farmers answer in the initial time of the interviews, farmers did provide answers after careful thinking and recalling; despite this many answers might not be right and subject to personal experience. In a later study, the authors would like to see whether there is any co-relation between farmers\\' perception of climate change and their risk management behaviors. For this report simple statistical results are presented in Table 5. The results show that farmers did perceive some changes in climate (Table 5). Most of the farmers (82.9%) perceived that the air temperature has risen gradually in the past ten years. Only 5.6% and 9.2% of them perceived a decreasing trend and unchanged temperatures, respectively, in the same time period. Different from the air temperature change perception, the responses to the change of precipitation were diversified. More than half of the farmers (54.7%) thought that the average precipitation in the past ten years has tended to decrease. The proportions of farmers who gave the answer of \"increasing\" was 23.4%. # Table 5 |Farmers\\' Perceptions towards Climate Change|Total|Guangdong|Shanxi|Qinghai| |---|---|---|---|---| |No. of obs.|%|No. of obs.|%|No. of obs.|%|No. of obs.|%| |Panel A: Farmers\\' perceptions of changes in temperature in the past 10 years|Total|620|100|240|100.0|180|100|200|100| |Rising|514|82.9|200|83.3|123|68.3|191|95.5| |Declining|35|5.6|7|2.9|24|13.3|4|2.0| |No change|57|9.2|27|11.3|26|14.4|4|2.0| |Unknown|14|2.3|6|2.5|7|3.9|1|0.5| |Panel B: Farmers\\' perceptions of changes in precipitation in the past 10 years|Total|620|100|240|100|180|100|200|100| |Rising|145|23.4|33|13.8|77|42.8|35|17.5| |Declining|339|54.7|129|53.8|65|36.1|145|72.5| |No change|102|16.5|53|22.1|33|18.3|16|8.0| |Unknown|34|5.5|25|10.4|5|2.8|4|2.0| Note: Data from the authors\\' survey. --- # Understanding Farmer‚Äôs Perceptions and\\n5) Climate Change| |Frank, E., Eakin, H., & L√≥pez-Carr, D.

Household size varies from 1 to 12 members with a mean of 4.9 persons. # 3.2 Knowledge of farmers about climate change and GHG emission. Interviewees were asked about their knowledge related to climate change (Table 1, Questions (1) and (2)). Table 3 reports the percentage distributions of responses to these questions. Over half of the farmers (52.9%) indicated that they knew the concept of global climate change (Question (1)). There is not obvious knowledge difference among regions. For example, about 47.5%, 57.2%, and 55.5% answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù in Guangdong, Shanxi, and Qinghai respectively. The second question (Question (2)) was a follow-up conditional on having answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù in Question (1). As shown in Table 3, conditional on knowing the concept of climate change, a vast majority (91.2%) of the respondents answered that the temperature is reported to be rising. As such, in all the three provinces the percentage reached at least 85%. Household interviewees were also asked about their knowledge related to the concept of GHG emission (Table 1, Questions (3) and (4)), which is another important concept associated with climate change. Their answers are shown in Table 4. The percentage of farmers who have heard about the\\n2) of priority for policy interventions. Finally, a great deal of interest also exists in analyzing the direct impact of perceptions on adaptation. To have more policy implications on adaptive risk management, more research efforts should be made in collecting data on dynamic perceptions on both climate change and extreme events.

Household size varies from 1 to 12 members with a mean of 4.9 persons. # 3.2 Knowledge of farmers about climate change and GHG emission. Interviewees were asked about their knowledge related to climate change (Table 1, Questions (1) and (2)). Table 3 reports the percentage distributions of responses to these questions. Over half of the farmers (52.9%) indicated that they knew the concept of global climate change (Question (1)). There is not obvious knowledge difference among regions. For example, about 47.5%, 57.2%, and 55.5% answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù in Guangdong, Shanxi, and Qinghai respectively. The second question (Question (2)) was a follow-up conditional on having answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù in Question (1). As shown in Table 3, conditional on knowing the concept of climate change, a vast majority (91.2%) of the respondents answered that the temperature is reported to be rising. As such, in all the three provinces the percentage reached at least 85%. Household interviewees were also asked about their knowledge related to the concept of GHG emission (Table 1, Questions (3) and (4)), which is another important concept associated with climate change. Their answers are shown in Table 4. The percentage of farmers who have heard about the\\n2) of priority for policy interventions. Finally, a great deal of interest also exists in analyzing the direct impact of perceptions on adaptation. To have more policy implications on adaptive risk management, more research efforts should be made in collecting data on dynamic perceptions on both climate change and extreme events.

In addition, some crop production information of the household, and some demographic information of the respondents (gender, education level, age, residence location) and household characteristics (household size, acreage of land owned, and wealth) were also collected. The latter information would probe deeper into the insights and perspectives of farmers. In this research the authors mainly dealt with four major issues. The first concerned farmers‚Äô knowledge about climate change. More specifically, the authors asked them if they heard about ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù and if so, what they had heard about the temperatures becoming higher or lower? By use of an open question, the authors additionally asked farmers to identify the main channels of receiving knowledge about climate change. The second issue concerned farmers‚Äô perceptions of climate change; the authors asked the following two sets of questions about farmers‚Äô perceptions on long-term changes in mean temperature, mean precipitation and the frequency of extreme weather events (such as drought, flood, and frost) in the past ten years. The third issue concerned farmers‚Äô knowledge towards the relationship between GHG emission and climate change. The authors want to specify whether a relationship exists between farmers‚Äô perceptions of climate change and chemical fertilizer application. The last issue concerned farmers‚Äô reactions to three possible extreme weather events; whether they would adjust cropping structure (changing to different crops) when the weather becomes hotter and rainfall decreases. # Analysis Survey results were entered into STATA version 11.2 for analysis. Basic descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample population and responses to each question. # Farmers‚Äô Perceptions on Climate Change # Individual and household socio-economic characteristics In the household survey, the authors also collected detailed information on their basic socio-economic characteristics. Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for\\n4) \"unchanged\" 16.5% precipitation were almost the same. # Perceptions of farmers towards climate change and variability # Perceptions of farmers towards long term climate change In a household survey, the authors asked the following two sets of questions, farmers\\' perception on air temperature, precipitation and the frequency of extreme weather events in the past ten years (Table 1, Questions (6)¬±(10)). While these questions were difficult for many farmers answer in the initial time of the interviews, farmers did provide answers after careful thinking and recalling; despite this many answers might not be right and subject to personal experience. In a later study, the authors would like to see whether there is any co-relation between farmers\\' perception of climate change and their risk management behaviors. For this report simple statistical results are presented in Table 5. The results show that farmers did perceive some changes in climate (Table 5). Most of the farmers (82.9%) perceived that the air temperature has risen gradually in the past ten years. Only 5.6% and 9.2% of them perceived a decreasing trend and unchanged temperatures, respectively, in the same time period. Different from the air temperature change perception, the responses to the change of precipitation were diversified. More than half of the farmers (54.7%) thought that the average precipitation in the past ten years has tended to decrease. The proportions of farmers who gave the answer of \"increasing\" was 23.4%. # Table 5 |Farmers\\' Perceptions towards Climate Change|Total|Guangdong|Shanxi|Qinghai| |---|---|---|---|---| |No. of obs.|%|No. of obs.|%|No. of obs.|%|No. of obs.|%| |Panel A: Farmers\\' perceptions of changes in temperature in the past 10 years|Total|620|100|240|100.0|180|100|200|100| |Rising|514|82.9|200|83.3|123|68.3|191|95.5| |Declining|35|5.6|7|2.9|24|13.3|4|2.0| |No change|57|9.2|27|11.3|26|14.4|4|2.0| |Unknown|14|2.3|6|2.5|7|3.9|1|0.5| |Panel B: Farmers\\' perceptions of changes in precipitation in the past 10 years|Total|620|100|240|100|180|100|200|100| |Rising|145|23.4|33|13.8|77|42.8|35|17.5| |Declining|339|54.7|129|53.8|65|36.1|145|72.5| |No change|102|16.5|53|22.1|33|18.3|16|8.0| |Unknown|34|5.5|25|10.4|5|2.8|4|2.0| Note: Data from the authors\\' survey. --- # Understanding Farmer‚Äôs Perceptions and\\n5) Climate Change| |Frank, E., Eakin, H., & L√≥pez-Carr, D.

In the view of Asfaw et al. (2015) adaptation to climate change is an adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. Page 2 of 15 --- # Lemessa et al., Cogent Food & Agriculture (2019), 5: 1640835 https://doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2019.1640835 The literature on climate change impacts and the vulnerability of agricultural sector is increasingly recognizing the important role of adaptation strategies (Smit & Skinner, 2002). Adaptation strategies are required as they contribute to mitigate the high incidence of climate change related problems. These strategies are relevant for smallholder farmers who are highly exposed to the threats of climate changes. The relevance of adaptations strategies plied by smallholders farmers are pronged into four folds: (i) it enables them to evaluate and choose the best alternatives, (ii) it helps them to practice new way of production system to address climate-related shocks and ensures their survival, (iii) it assists them to change/modify production systems in line with the effect of climate change, and (iv) it helps to design policies to tackle the challenges that climate change is posing on smallholder farmers. Moreover, identifying the adaptation strategies for particular crop than for the entire agricultural sector helps to device an appropriate climate change policies. Climate change adaptation strategy studies on agriculture are abundant (Belay et al., 2017; Campbell et al., 2016; Gbegbelegbe et al., 2017; Mulatu, 2013; Tesfaye & Seifu, 2016), but adaptation strategies on root crops, particularly potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production was forlorn.

Similar to the finding of the study by Tesfahun (2018), drought, soil erosion, and water log were intensively challenging potato production in the study area as reported by quite half of the respondents. Frost (wurchi/amadey) is the worst type of climate change-induced problem to potatoes production as reported by 90% of the respondents, see Figure 4. Frost (wurchi/amadey) which occurs in two-to-three laps of years not only affects potatoes production but also the production of khat (Chata edulis forsk), the most widely grown cash crop in the study area. As smallholder farmers‚Äô livelihood mainly depends on the production of the two crops, the adverse effects of climate change on their production aggravate food insecurity in the area. --- # 3.4.

        "3) commonly called frost (Wurchi/Amadey). According to Tesfaye and Seifu (2016), the eastern Ethiopian highlands suffer from food production deficits and of high livelihoods vulnerability due to the aforementioned climate change-induced risks. Therefore, the rate of food production has failed to keep pace with the high rate of population growth resulting in high levels of food insecurity. Despite the relevance of studying climate change adaptation strategies in response to food insecurity, empirical studies are strikingly scant on climate change adaptations strategies for root crops. Even the few existing empirical studies considered bundles of adaptation strategies as independent of one another. Moreover, these studies failed to capture the possibilities of reverse causation between the strategies (Acquah, 2011; Belay et al., 2017; Deressa, Hassan, Ringler, Alemu, & Yesuf, 2009; Fosu-Mensah, Vlek, & MacCarthy, 2012; Tesfaye & Seifu, 2016). --- # Methodology # Study setting This study was carried out in eastern part of Ethiopia, particularly eastern Hararghe Zone of Oromia National Regional State. The study area is characterized by high population density, rainfall variability, frequent drought occurrence, crop failure, severe land degradation, and increased vulnerability to chronic food insecurity (Tesfaye & Seifu, 2016). Although the amount and pattern vary locally, rainfall is bimodal in distribution; a short season from March to May is known as Belg, and a longer rainy reason from July to September is known as Kiremt seasons. The amount of rainfall varies between 650 and 750 mm, while the average temperature of the study area varies between 25¬∞C and 30¬∞C. The maximum and minimum mean annual temperatures for the area are 23.8¬∞C and 9.6¬∞C, respectively (Alemayehu, Furi, & Legesse, 2007; Mulugeta et al., 2018). Smallholder farmers in the zone have rich experience in root crops and vegetable production, irrigation usage and intercropping. The major crops grown are sorghum and maize\n",

Adger et al. (2009a) summarize this conversation as consisting of two strands. The first is concerned with how adaptation to climate change can be facilitated and enhanced through policies and institutional change, and the second with whether limits to adaptation exist and what underlies these limits. Earlier, Smit et al. (2000) positioned these two approaches into somewhat different categories‚Äîfirst, studies focused on adaptation as a potential policy and prescription, and second, those interested in what adaptations are expected or likely in different systems. In my analysis of smallholder farmers‚Äô vulnerabilities to climate change, I speak more directly to the second discussion, which considers constraints on peoples‚Äô adaptive capacities with consequences that are ethically and politically unacceptable, including adaptations that are expected or already happening (Adger et al. 2009a). The literature‚Äôs focus on adaptation limits lends itself toward the conception of thresholds. Consequently, adaptation limits are seen as absolute and objective biophysical, economic, and technological measures like insurmountable economic costs for Tanzania as a nation and smallholder farming communities, or irreversible changes to sensitive physical systems such as seasonal rainfall patterns. Economistic approaches that estimate the effects of exogenous biophysical factors like drought on agricultural productivity are part of this endeavor (Dell et al. 2014). Adger et al. (2009a) begin to critique this literature by suggesting that limits are actually endogenous, or contingently emerging in place at social and individual levels, rather than externally imposed. From these ideas of adaptation, a public and scholarly discourse around limits has emerged that outlines two possible trajectories. Either Tanzanian smallholder farmers are\\n3) among these differently located knowledges (Haraway 1988; Harding 1991). The sociology of climate adaptation knowledge is another related area in which sociologists can make important contributions. Moreover, the agro-historical context of a region influences how effective local agricultural knowledge is for climate adaptation. For example, even though crop agriculture is the primary livelihood in the two communities today, these parts of Tanzania have a history that is far more pastoralist than agricultural, which affects the collection of local adaptive knowledge for crops like maize, rice, and cassava. Sociol Dev (Oakl). Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 October 05. --- # Author Manuscript However, this perspective should not make the farmers seem incapable or diminish their agency. As Hulme (2011) writes about the climate reductionist perspective, ‚ÄúHumans are depicted as ‚Äòdumb farmers‚Äô passively awaiting their climate fate. The possibilities of human agency are relegated to footnotes.‚Äù Academic and media discourses are exhausted with stories about climate change victims in the global South. This paper does present the difficult and somewhat bleak context within which farmers are coping, but it is also a narrative about the agency that farmers exhibit in response to these conditions and the adaptive capacity they have. Despite water access constraints, northern village farmers find ways to put pressure on the system that does not incorporate them and to obtain the water they need (Anand 2011). Whether agency consists of getting water in any way possible, finding a route to a better market by bicycle, or adjusting the crops they grow, farmers find opportunities to protect or improve their livelihoods despite their positions in the world socio-ecological system. Finally, this case illustrates that social (in)equality cannot be disconnected from environmental issues like climate change.

Specific approaches are needed to scale-up resource-intensive technologies (Fanya juu, Zai pits, and Negarims) compared to less resource-intensive technologies. 1. Introduction 1.1. Background Rain-fed agriculture is estimated to contribute about 60% of the world‚Äôs crop production (FAO, 2009). For many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture is the most important sector of the economy with significant multiplier effects and about 60% to 70% of the total population from the region living in rural areas and largely depending on small-scale subsistence agriculture for their livelihood (Rockstrom, 2000). Further, rainfall is relatively inadequate and shows high spatial and temporal variability, which is associated with prolonged dry spells during the growing season (Jaetzold et al., 2006). Several scientific investigations have shown that rainwater harvesting technologies are important in enhancing productive water use whilst raising crop yield levels (Karpouzoglou and Barron, 2014) in delicate semi-arid agro-ecosystems. In Tharaka South Sub-county, seasonal rainfall varies a lot around the mean, with occasions of subsequent\n",
        "3) below average rainfall (Ngetich et al., 2014). Persistence of below normal rainfall in Tharaka is a risk to livelihoods which aggravates vulnerability to hunger and famine in this semi-arid area (Icheria, 2015). Various water harvesting and saving technologies have been successfully tested and popularized by governmental and non-governmental agencies (Pachpute et al., 2010). Since the 1950s, several rainwater harvesting and saving technologies have been introduced in Kenya (Tiffen et al., 1994). Despite the biophysical and socio-economic benefits of rainwater harvesting and saving technologies, adoption of soil and water conservation technologies has remained low, especially in Kenya‚Äôs semi-arid zones (Kahinda and Taigbenu, 2011). Few of these efforts have succeeded in combining technical efficiency with social acceptability to local farmers (Pachpute et al., 2010). The Kenya‚Äôs Vision 2030 and the --- # F.W. Muriu-Ng‚Äôang‚Äôa et al. / Agricultural Water Management 194 (2017) 150‚Äì159 National Climate Change Action Plan recognizes rainwater harvesting and saving technologies as crucial in achieving the goals of socio-economic development, climate change resilience and sustainability (Republic of Kenya, 2013). However the adoption and utilization of these technologies in Kenya has been shaped by interactions of biophysical and socio-economic factors which have not been sufficiently studied (Furlow et al., 2011). There is lack of scientific knowledge on smallholder farmer‚Äôs adoption and utilization behavior of resource-intensive and less resource-intensive rainwater harvesting and saving technologies. Thus the following study aims to establish socio-economic factors influencing their use (or non-use) in Tharaka Sub-County. Six types of in situ rainwater harvesting and saving technologies which were practiced for soil and water conservation in Tharaka South are described. The technologies selected included 3 highly resource intensive (in terms of labour and knowledge requirements) [including Fanya juu, Zai pits, and Negarims] and 3 less resource intensive technologies [including Grass strips, stone lines and trash lines].
