Farmers are frequently exposed to pest and disease outbreaks and extreme weather events (particularly cyclones), which cause significant crop and income losses and exacerbate food insecurity. Although farmers use a variety of risk-coping strategies, these are insufficient to prevent them from remaining food insecure.

We found substantial communitylevel changes in fishing patterns since 1996: southern trawl fleets of larger vessels with low catch diversity fished up to 400 km further north, while trawl fleets of smaller vessels with low catch diversity shrank or disappeared from the data set over time. In contrast, trawl fleets (of both large and small vessels) with higher catch diversity neither changed fishing location dramatically or nor disappeared as often from the data set.

Second, the paper describes how farmers respond to climate change and tries to assess the determinants of their adaptation. Based on data collected from a survey among farm households in three provinces in rural China, the findings demonstrate that farmers are aware of climate variability and identify the rising temperature, decreasing precipitation and the increasing frequency of drought. Only about 25% of farmers are willing to adjust their farming structures as a risk reaction.

It is concluded that the adaptation policy and investment decisions should take into account these determinants in order to enhance the adaptive capacity of the rural farmers in the cyclone- and flood-prone regions of the state.|||A study exploring the determinants of adopting adaptation responses to extreme climates in India, including discussion of barriers to adaptation.|||The paper analyses adaptation strategies adopted by farmers|||This study identifies determinants of farm-level adaptation measures to cyclones and floods based on a cross-sectional survey data collected during the 2010Ã¢â‚¬â€œ11 production season in the selected disaster prone districts in Odisha.", Asia,India, Individuals or households,Low,"Limited|||Shallow, although some evidence of engagement with institutions, perhaps indicate some deeper responses.|||Small and ad hoc adaptation implementation carried out by farmers.","What drives farmers to adopt farm-level adaptation practices to climate extremes: Empirical evidence from Odisha, India",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"Bahinipati, CS; Venkatachalam, L","Bahinipati, CS; Venkatachalam, L, What drives farmers to adopt farm-level adaptation practices to climate extremes: Empirical evidence from Odisha, India, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION","Bahinipati, CS; Venkatachalam, L, What drives farmers to adopt farm-level adaptation practices to climate extremes: Empirical evidence from Odisha, India, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION"
